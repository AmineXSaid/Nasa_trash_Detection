In many places, plastic is the main type of debris that you will see as you walk along a beach. In other locations, construction debris or fishing gear may be a common sight.Single-use and disposable items are deeply ingrained in our everyday lives. If you look around right now, you will see many objects that you are eventually going to throw away. As a society, we have moved increasingly towards on-the-go lifestyles where we value the convenience of these disposable items.If we want to stop the flow of trash into our ocean and Great Lakes, everyone, including government, businesses, and people like you, will have to make some meaningful changes.The story of plastic is the story of all of us.That's why we ,Milkyway Team ,we chose this challenge because we are facing an ongoing environmental disaster in our world, and our oceans receive about 12 million tons of waste each year, presenting many ecosystem problems.Thinking about an idea of creating an Autonomus GPS Based Water Drone named CUD:CleanUp Drone Which detects ,Classifies ,Quantifies the debris and save the coordinates of the grabage patches .Then the collection phase comes from another ship ,weather a marine debris collecting ship  'THe mothership' where se are going to collect the garbage  or any one of the existing  ship that saved their ids as participants of this work!")
